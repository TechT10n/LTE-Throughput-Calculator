# LTE-Throughput-Calculator
I do not intend to take credit for the base calculations in this script.

The javascript & formulas used here is a modified version of this online calculator...

Most of the credit goes to it's original creator, Alexey Anisimov. I simply expanded upon that source code to add support for Carrier Aggregation into his calculations.

I highly encourage you to read the source website for a good tutorial on how this throughput is calculated.

It requires PHP in it's current revision, to generate the HTML dropdowns. Though it would be fairly trivial to re-write that part in javascript or some other language.

This is a minor edit
